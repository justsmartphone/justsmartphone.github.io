Fortunately, it&rsquo;s easy to get the app version code in Android. Here we&rsquo;ll show you three unique ways to get it.</p><p>The first way to get the app version code is to use the PackageInfo class. This class provides information about the package, such as the version number and code of the package. With PackageInfo, you can easily access the version code of the application as it is in the versionCode property.</p><p>The second way to get the app version code is by using the PackageManager class. This class provides access to the package manager service. You can access the app version code by calling the getPackageInfo() method which returns the PackageInfo object.</p><p>The third way to get the app version code is by using the Build Config class. This class provides access to the information stored in the build configuration of the project. With this class, you can access the app version code by calling the getBuildConfigValue() method.</p><p>All of these methods are easy and straightforward to use. With them, you can quickly get the app version code in Android without much hassle.</p><h3 id=1-overview-of-app-version-code-in-android>1. Overview of App Version Code in Android<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-overview-of-app-version-code-in-android>#</a></h3><p>If you’re an Android developer, you may need to know the version code of your app. To do this, you need to find out the app’s VersionCode. The VersionCode is an integer that shows the current version of your app. Here are 3 ways to get the app version code in Android.</p><p>The first way is to use the “PackageManager”. This class provides access to information about the application package that is currently installed on the device. To get the app version code using PackageManager, use the “getPackageInfo()” method.</p><p>The second way is to use the “BuildConfig” class. This class contains information about the current build configuration, such as the version code. To get the app version code, use the “getVersionCode()” method.</p><p>The third way is to use the “Build” class. This class provides access to various information about the current build. To get the app version code using the Build class, use the “getVersionCode()” method.</p><p>These are 3 ways to get the app version code in Android. With these methods, you can easily get the version code of your app and make sure it is up to date.</p><h3 id=2-steps-to-retrieve-app-version-code-in-android>2. Steps to Retrieve App Version Code in Android<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-steps-to-retrieve-app-version-code-in-android>#</a></h3><p>Getting the version code of an Android app is a useful task to know for troubleshooting and to ensure that you are running the latest version. This article will explain three different ways on how to get the version code of an Android app.</p><p>The first way to get the version code is to use the Android Package Manager (APM) command line tool. To do this, open the command line window and type in “adb shell pm list packages -f [package-name]”, where package-name is the name of the app you want to know the version code for. This will return a line of code that includes the version code.</p><p>The second way to get the version code is to use a file explorer app such as ES File Explorer. Using the app, find the APK file of the app you wish to check the version code for, tap the “i” icon displayed next to the file’s name and you should now find the version code listed as the app’s version.</p><p>The third way to get the version code is to check the Google Play store. If the app is still hosted on Google Play, you can go to the app’s page and view the version code in the “Additional Information” section. This allows you to quickly check what the latest version is and compare it with the version code you have on your device.</p><p>By using one of these methods you can easily find the version code of any Android app you have installed. This can help you to keep track of what version you have installed and to make sure you have the latest version available.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmkUCTq3FY0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q 1: How to get App version code in Android?

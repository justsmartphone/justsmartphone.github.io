Connecting Devices for File Transfer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-connecting-devices-for-file-transfer>#</a></h3><p>Transferring files between two devices can be an easy task or a frustrating one for some people. One of the most useful technologies for this task is Bluetooth, which allows two devices to easily connect and exchange data. If you&rsquo;re trying to transfer files from an Android device to an iPhone via Bluetooth, here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p><p>First, make sure that both devices have Bluetooth enabled. If needed, look for the Bluetooth button or switch on your device and enable it. Then, on both devices, just search for the other device&rsquo;s name and connect them to each other. With the two devices connected, select the file you intend to transfer and tap ‘Share’.</p><p>Next, you will be asked to select how you want to share the file. Choose Bluetooth from the menu option. On the receiving device, a pop-up notification will appear to accept the transfer. Once accepted, the transfer of the selected file should begin.</p><p>Finally, the transfer process may take a little while, depending on the size of the file. Once the transfer is complete, you&rsquo;ll get a notification on both devices that the transfer is finished. And that&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;ve successfully transferred files from your Android device to your iPhone via Bluetooth.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVH2R0-qoEI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.

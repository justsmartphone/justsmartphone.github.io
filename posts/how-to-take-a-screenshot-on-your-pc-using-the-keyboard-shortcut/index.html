Whether it’s to capture a funny meme or share a software bug with your tech support team, this simple technique comes in quite handy.\nTo take advantage of this feature, all you need is a keyboard with the ‘Print Screen’ button. This button is usually located at the top right corner, beside the F12 key. Pressing and holding the ‘Alt’ and ‘Print Screen’ buttons together will capture a single window or application currently open on your PC. If you want to take a snapshot of your entire screen, then press both ‘Ctrl’ and ‘Print Screen’ together instead. Once you’ve done that, you can paste the image into an image editing software and make any adjustments to it you wish.\nThe ‘Print Screen’ shortcut is an essential tool for any PC user, and its simplicity makes it a joy to use. You won’t need to waste time opening up other programs - with just a few button presses, you’ll have your screenshot right away. So next time you need to capture something from your screen, be sure to try out this convenient shortcut.\n1. Introduction to Taking a Screenshot on Your PC Taking a screenshot is an incredibly convenient tool for capturing what’s on your computer screen in a static image. Whether you need to share a specific window of your screen with someone, or you’d simply like to capture a moment in time, a screenshot will help you to do just that. Taking a screenshot on your PC is incredibly simple, and can be accomplished using only the keyboard and your favourite image editing software. In this article, we’ll explain how to take a screenshot on your PC using the keyboard shortcut.\nIt’s worth noting that modern systems such as Windows 10 and macOS have their own built-in screenshot functions—but for the sake of simplicity, let’s focus on the keyboard shortcut method. To begin, you’ll need to make sure that your image editing software of choice is open and active. Windows users should typically use the Paint program, while Mac users should use the Preview application.\nOnce you’ve got your image editing software open, you can begin to take screenshots using the keyboard shortcut. The most common shortcut is ‘Print Screen’, or ‘PrtScn’ for short. Pressing this button will capture a screenshot of your entire desktop, including all programs, windows and taskbars. To save the image, simply paste the captured image into your image editing program and select ‘Save’.\nIf you don’t want to include the taskbar and other additional windows in your screenshot, hold down the ‘Alt’ key and press ‘PrtScn’. This will capture only the active window—in other words, the window currently in focus. This is particularly useful if you’d like to capture a specific part of your screen.\nAlternatively, you can use the ‘Windows’ key + ‘Shift’ + ‘S’ shortcut to open the Snip \u0026 Sketch program in Windows 10. This will allow you to select a specific part of your screen to capture, as opposed to capturing the entire desktop.\nIn conclusion, taking a screenshot on your PC is incredibly simple using only the keyboard and your favourite image editing software. The keyboard shortcut ‘Print Screen’ will capture a screenshot of your entire desktop, and holding ‘Alt’ and pressing ‘PrtScn’ will capture only the active window. Windows 10 users have other options, such as the Snip \u0026 Sketch program, that allow you to capture a more specific part of your desktop.\nHow to Take a Screenshot on Your PC Taking a screenshot on your PC is an excellent way to capture an image of your computer screen and save it for future reference. In this tutorial, we’ll discuss how to take a screenshot on a PC through the built-in Windows 10 tools as well as how to use the keyboard shortcut. Doing so is as easy as pressing a few buttons and that can save you time and effort.\nIf you’re using Windows 10, the best way to take a screenshot is by pressing the ‘Windows Logo’ + ‘PrtSc’ key on your keyboard. Doing so will take a screenshot of your entire computer screen and save it as an image file, which you can then find in your ‘Pictures’ folder in the ‘Screenshots’ folder. There is also an ‘Alt + PrtSc’ shortcut, which will take a screenshot of the active window rather than the entire screen.\nAnother option is to use the ‘Snipping Tool’, which is a built-in utility that allows you to select an area of the screen to be saved as an image. This is useful if you only need to capture a portion of the screen rather than the whole thing. To access this tool, simply search for ‘Snipping Tool’ in the Start Menu or type ‘SnippingTool’ in the Run dialogue box.\nLastly, you can also use the ‘Snip \u0026 Sketch’ app, which came with Windows 10, to take a screenshot. This app has more advanced features than the Snipping Tool, such as being able to annotate and draw over the screenshot. To access this app, simply search for ‘Snip \u0026 Sketch’ on the Start Menu.\nNo matter which approach you choose, following this tutorial will help you take a screenshot on your PC and save it for future reference.\nUsing Keyboard Shortcuts Taking a screenshot is a great way to save information from your computer.

Finally, press the “Channel Scan” option and it will automatically scan for available channels in your region.</p><p>Q : What is a “Channel Scan”?
A : A channel scan is a process that allows a TV to search for available TV channels in the region. The process requires information such as the type of connection, the type of antenna, and the region where it’s currently located.</p><p>Q : What is the difference between an “Antenna” and a “Cable” connection?
A : An antenna connection allows you to receive free over-the-air broadcast TV channels, while a cable connection allows you to receive paid TV services from a cable provider.</p><p>Q : Can I edit the list of available channels?
A : Yes, you can edit the list of available channels on your TCL Android TV. To do so, go to the “Settings” menu, select “TV Inputs”, and choose “Channel List”. In the “Channel List” page, you can add or delete channels by selecting the “+” or “-” icon.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://justsmartphone.github.io/posts/mastering-the-art-of-scanning-channels-on-samsung-tvs/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Mastering the Art of Scanning Channels on Samsung TVs</span></a>

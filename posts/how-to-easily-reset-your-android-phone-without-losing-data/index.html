Steps to Reset Android Phone Without Losing Data<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-steps-to-reset-android-phone-without-losing-data>#</a></h3><p>Data safety is one of the biggest concerns in the digital age we&rsquo;re living in. The amount of personal data that people store on their phones and computers now is unprecedented, and with cyber security threats growing more and more every day. Here are a few tips and tricks to help you keep your data safe:</p><ol><li><p>Use complex passwords and regularly change them. A uniquely complex password made up of a variety of characters and numbers will make it much harder for an unauthorized person to gain access to your data. Also, make sure to regularly change your passwords to make sure any breached passwords won&rsquo;t work.</p></li><li><p>Regularly update your phone and computer operating systems. By keeping your devices up-to-date, you are ensuring that they are the least vulnerable to security threats.</p></li><li><p>Use two-factor authentication. This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts and data by making sure that even if someone gets ahold of your password, they won&rsquo;t be able to access your account without the second form of authentication, usually a code sent to your phone.</p></li><li><p>Backup your data. By regularly backing up your data, you can make sure that even if your phone or computer is lost or stolen, you won&rsquo;t lose all of your data. Additionally, you can use special software such as Titanium Backup to keep a backup of your phone even if you need to reset it without losing any data.</p></li></ol><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGZ1i5MpWCw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: How can I reset my Android phone without losing data?</p><p>A: You can reset your Android phone without losing data quite easily.

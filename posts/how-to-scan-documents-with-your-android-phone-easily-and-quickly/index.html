Preparing to Scan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-preparing-to-scan>#</a></h3><p>Scanning documents on your Android phone is a simple and convenient way to manage your paperwork. Here are three tips for scanning documents quickly and efficiently.</p><p>First, make sure there is enough light in the room when scanning. To ensure accurate scans, use natural sunlight or a lamp to create a bright, even illumination. This will prevent shadows and distortion in your scans.</p><p>Second, make sure the document is flat against the surface. A slight curve on the paper will create a distorted scan. Place the document on a flat surface and press down on the edges of the document with your hands to flatten it.</p><p>Third, keep the phone directly above the document. At this angle, your phone&rsquo;s camera will better capture all of the details of the document. Make sure you don&rsquo;t move the camera while scanning, or your scan might be blurry.</p><p>With these tips, you can scan documents quickly and efficiently on your Android phone.</p><h3 id=2-scanning-document-with-your-android-phone>2.

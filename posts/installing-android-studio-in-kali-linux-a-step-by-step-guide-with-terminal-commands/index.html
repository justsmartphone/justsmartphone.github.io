First, it&rsquo;s important to install Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal: sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk. Once the installation completes, the user needs to run the following command to set the default Java version to JDK 8: sudo update-alternatives &ndash;config java.</p><p>Next, the user needs to install other dependencies before installing Android Studio. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal: sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386 and then sudo apt-get install libqt5widgets5 libqt5svg5 libqt5webkit5 libqt5sql5.</p><p>Once the dependencies are installed, the user can now download the Linux version of Android Studio from the official developer website. After the .zip file is downloaded, the user needs to extract the file in the &lsquo;opt&rsquo; directory which can be done by running the command sudo unzip -d opt android-studio*. Then, the user needs to set the permissions for the &lsquo;opt&rsquo; directory by running the command sudo chmod -R 755 opt.</p><p>The final step is to launch the program by running the command cd opt/android-studio/bin followed by ./studio.sh. This will open up the first-time setup window of Android Studio. The user can now customise the settings and begin developing apps for Android.</p><h3 id=1-install-android-studio-on-kali-linux>1.
